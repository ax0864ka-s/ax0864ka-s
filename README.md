# Hi there, I'm Axel 

### Future Information systems specialist
I am a final-year student in Design of Information Systems at the Lund School of Economics and Management. My passion lies at the intersection of business strategy and technology—I strive to build technical solutions that drive real organizational value.

As I transition from academia to the professional world, I am eager to apply my technical foundation in real-world development scenarios. My goal is to contribute immediately while continuously refining my skills to define my long-term area of expertise.

-  **Currently working on:** A cloud-native secure file transfer platform as my final-year BSc project.
-  **Location:** Malmö/Copenhagen.
